# OnLibrary Mobile

## üí° Project's Idea

This project was developed to create a mobile application for the online library platform.

## üîç Features

* Login and signup to the application;
* Books listing and details;

## üíπ Extras

* Push Notifications;
* Multiple languages support;

## üõ† Technologies

During the development of this project, the following techologies were used:

- [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/)
- [React Native Paper](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-paper/)
- [React Native Paper Dates](https://github.com/web-ridge/react-native-paper-dates)
- [React Native Image Picker](https://github.com/react-native-image-picker/react-native-image-picker)
- [React Native Document Picker](https://github.com/rnmods/react-native-document-picker)
- [React Native QR Code Scanner](https://github.com/moaazsidat/react-native-qrcode-scanner)
- [React Native Chart Kit](https://github.com/indiespirit/react-native-chart-kit)
- [Firebase Cloud Messaging](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

## üíª Project Configuration

### First, install the dependencies for the project

```bash
$ yarn
```

## üåê Setting up config files

You need to update the API settings file (./src/services/api.ts) according to the base URL for the API used as the backend for the application:

```typescript
import axios from 'axios';

const api = axios.create({
    // Modify regarding the server address and device being used (Android emulator, iOS emulator, etc.)
    baseURL: "http://10.0.2.2:3333",
})

export default api;
```

You must also provide the *google-services.json* file (should be placed in ./android/app/google-services.json) with the Firebase app credentials.

## ‚èØÔ∏è Running

To run the project in a development environment, execute the following command on the root directory.

```bash
$ # For Android devices
$ yarn android
$ # For iOS devices (on Mac computers only)
$ yarn ios
```

## üî® Project's *Build* for *Deploy*

In order to publish the app for the app stores of different kinds of devices (Play Store, App Store), there are some steps to be done.

### Android
Aside from [configuring for app publishing with React Native](https://reactnative.dev/docs/signed-apk-android), we should execute the following commands to generate the *.aab* (Android App Bundle) file:

```bash
$ cd android
$ ./gradlew bundleRelease
```

The generated file will be located at ```android/app/build/outputs/bundle/release/```.
